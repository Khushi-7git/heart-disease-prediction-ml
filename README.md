# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health indicators using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest models.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is built to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease using various health-related features. Multiple ML algorithms were tested, and the **Random Forest Classifier** was selected as the final model based on accuracy and ROC AUC score.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical variables  
- Trained with Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest    
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
- Real-patient prediction support  

---

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest (Final selected model)
